# Identifying Factors Affecting Mental Health Care: An Analysis with Data Visualization

This project provides visualizations of factors influencing people's attitudes towards mental health care using a dataset of responses on mental health attitudes and symptoms. The script file can generate various charts, including bar charts, radar charts, and choropleth maps, to analyze the data.

## Features
### Dataset
The dataset depicts people's attitudes towards mental health and how different factors can affect this. The dataset contains 17 columns and 292,364 records.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Cleans and formats the mental health dataset.
- Renames columns for better readability.
- Handles missing values and converts date formats.

### Bar Charts:
Visualize the percentage of responses to mental health factors (e.g., Treatment, Coping Struggles, Mood Swings) across categories like occupation, self-employment, and indoor days. 

### Radar Charts:
Display radar charts highlighting the prevalence of various mental health issues (e.g., Growing Stress, Family History, Mood Swings) for different responses to care options and influencing factors.

### Choropleth Maps:
Geographical distribution of responses to mental health care options, family history, and treatment across different countries are shown.
